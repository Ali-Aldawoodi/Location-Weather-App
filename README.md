# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

--

* Create multiple locations by (IP Address and/or text address)

-ActiveRecord backed models

View the 7-day forecast for each location

-highlighting High and Low temps for each day

Bonus #1: Chart the highs/lows

Bonus #2: Leveraging Stimulus/Turbo for some of the CRUD interactions

If looking for a tutorial to get you up to speed on the current state of Stimulus/Turbo. I recommend the Handbooks and this 3rd Party Tutorial

Bonus #3: deploy the application to a PaaS such as Heroku, Render.com, or Fly (free)

To help you ramp up on Ruby, I often recommend Chris Pine's Learn to Program and/or the Ruby in 20 Minutes Tutorial. 



For getting a basic setup for Rails and some understanding the first few free chapters of the Rails tutorial are helpful. Although we typically do development locally on a Mac and use Rbenv to manage different ruby versions across projects. Install Rbenv via these instructions: https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#homebrew-on-macos



Assignment Expectations

Complete the application with ~8-12 hours of effort by February 6th

Share source code through Github with a README that documents how to use your program

Demonstrate ability to use unit and system tests with a strategy for handling data coming from 3rd party APIs

We would like to see what you could apply with tests, so this might be a bit of a stretch and that's ok

We typically use RSpec for our tests, system tests in RSpec
